                                                shown in trials to be highly effective at preventing symptomatic Covid disease.
                                                 These vaccines will arrive less than a year after the initial sequencing of the virus. 
                                                 For several months the demand will outstrip the supply. Doses will have to be rationed.
                                                  What’s the most equitable way to allocate this scarce resource?

                                                no matter how effective it is — violates bodily autonomy. In his landmark book “Constitution of Liberty,” 
                                                F.A. Hayek wrote that property rights are defined as having a “sphere of free action.” If that sphere

                                                The government has initially ordered 40 million doses, which will vaccinate 20 million people. The National 
                                                Health Service has said that more hubs will be set up as more doses arrive.
