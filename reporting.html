                                                But three kinds of evidence point to more than 250,000 deaths

                                                A persistent falsehood has been circulating on social media: the number of COVID deaths is much lower than official 
                                                statistics, and therefore the danger of the disease has been overblown. In August, President Donald Trump retweeted 
                                                a post claiming that only 6 percent of these reported deaths were actually from COVID-19.
